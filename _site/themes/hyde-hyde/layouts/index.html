  <span style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.6em;">WTF</span> is a personal information dashboard for your
  terminal, developed for those who spend most of their day in the command line.
  </p>

  <p>
  It provides a framework for rapidly viewing important at-a-glance information easily.
  </p>

  <p>
  Keep an eye on your OpsGenie schedules, Google Calendar, Git and Github repositories, and New Relic deployments.

  <p>
  See who's away in BambooHR, which Jira tickets are assigned to you, and what time it is in Barcelona.

  <!--<p>-->

  <p>
  It even has weather. And clocks. And emoji.
